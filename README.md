# Sign-up Form
This is the first project from The Odin Project Intermidiate HTML and CSS course.  <br />
You can try it live here: https://razvanbugoi.github.io/top_sign_up_form/src/index.html <br />
Please note that this is not mobile responsive as this was not a requirement.


## Objective
The idea behind this project is to get myself comfortable using CSS Grid and HTML forms. 


## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## The process and outcome
The first step I took was to create some HTML dummy content and define the overall layout of the page with CSS Grid. <br />
After this, I had two main sections that needed expanding upon - the left column with the image and the logo, and the right column that contained the form. <br />
I went ahead and tackled one section at a time by creating HTML content first, and then adding the necessary styles to position the elements properly and make them look nice. <br />
I used mdn documentation regularly to make sure the form is written using the right tags in the right places. <br />
The logic behind the form validation is written in JavaScript. I had to do a bit of research on the internet on how to do this as I have never done something like this in the past. <br />
Overall, I am happy with this small project as I learned more about HTML forms and forms validation, and also got some practice using CSS grid for positioning.
